.SH NAME
opencv-config \- script to get information about the installed version of OpenCV
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B opencv-config
.BI "[ \-\-prefix=" "DIR" " ]"
.B [ \-\-version ]
.BI "[ \-\-libs [" <extensions> "]]"
.B [ \-\-cflags | \-\-cxxflags ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B opencv\-config
is a tool that is used to configure and determine the compiler and linker
flags that should be used to compile and link programs, libraries and
plugins that use OpenCV.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-cflags
Print the C compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program or library
that uses OpenCV.
.TP
.B \-\-cxxflags
Print the C++ compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program or library
that uses OpenCV.
.TP
.BI "\-\-libs [" <extensions> "]"
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a program that uses
libcv. Optionally, add linker flags for the libhighgui, libcvcam and/or
libcvaux OpenCV extensions by appending highgui, cvcam and/or cvaux.
.TP
.BI "\-\-prefix=" DIR
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that libcv
was built with when computing the output for the \fB\-\-cflags\fR, \fB\-\-cxxflags\fR
and \fB\-\-libs\fR options. This option must be specified before any of the
other options.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Prints the currently installed version of libcv on standard output.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following example:
.IP
.B gcc \-o main.o $(opencv-config \-\-cflags) \-c main.c
.PP
shows how you might use
.B opencv\-config
to compile a C source file for an executable program or:
.IP
.B gcc \-o my_app $(opencv\-config \-\-libs) main.o util.o
.PP
how you might use
.B opencv\-config
to link compiled objects into an executable program.
