.SH NAME
opencv-createsamples \- create training and testing samples


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B opencv\-createsamples [options]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B opencv\-createsamples
creates positive samples from a single object image or a collection of
positive images.


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.B opencv\-createsamples
supports the following options:

.PP
.TP
.BI "\-info " collection_file_name
A database of positive source images.

.TP
.BI "\-img " image_file_name
A positive source image.

.TP
.BI "\-vec " vec_file_name
The output file name containing the generated positive samples for training.

.TP
.BI "\-bg " background_file_name
The background description file. It contains a list of images into which
randomly distorted versions of the object are pasted for positive sample
generation.

.TP
.BI "\-num " number_of_samples
The number of positive samples to generate. The default value is
.IR 1000 .

.TP
.BI "\-bgcolor " background_color
The background color for the sample image. The default is
.IR 0 .
.\" TODO: What does 0 mean? How are colors expressed with integers?

.TP
.BI "\-bgthresh " background_color_threshold
The background color threshold. Pixels whose colors are in range \[+-]
.I background_color_threshold
are considered as transparent.

.TP
.B \-inv
Invert the colors.
.TP
.B \-randinv
Invert the colors randomly.

.TP
.BI "\-maxidev " max_intensity_deviation
The desired maximum intensity deviation of foreground samples pixels. The
default is
.IR 40 .

.TP
.BI "\-maxxangle " max_x_rotation_angle
The maximum rotation angle in x-direction in radians. The default is
.IR 1.1 .

.TP
.BI "\-maxyangle " max_y_rotation_angle
The maximum rotation angle in y-direction in radians. The default is 
.IR 1.1 .

.TP
.BI "\-maxzangle " max_z_rotation_angle
The maximum rotation angle in z-direction in radians. The default is 
.IR 0.5 .

.TP
.BI "\-show [" scale_factor "]"
Show the created samples during the creation process. Optionally a scaling
factor can be defined. The default value is
.IR 4.0 .
.IP
If <\fBESC\fR> is pressed, the creation process will continue without showing
the samples. This can be useful for debugging purposes.

.TP
.BI "\-h " sample_height
The generated sample height. The default value is
.IR 24 .

.TP
.BI "\-w " sample_width
The generated sample width. The default value is
.IR 24 .

.PP
The same information is shown, if
.B opencv\-createsamples
is called without any arguments/options.


.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To create training samples from one image applying distortions and show the
results:
.IP
.B opencv\-createsamples -img source.png -num 10 -bg negatives.dat -vec samples_out.vec -show
.PP
To create training samples of size 40x40 from some images without applying
distortions:
.IP
.B opencv\-creasamples -info source.dat -vec samples_out.vec -w 40 -h 40
